Whats up guys!

So this is a collection of simple games that I am making to learn Python. Yes some are very stupid and cheesy, but I try to make them at least a little fun or challenging. Again, I am LEARNING so just remember that haha.

So to play these games you need to follow these steps:


For a windows computer (for you who don't know, if you have a computer that doesn't have an apple on it, than this is you haha)

1)	Go to www.python.org and click the "Downloads" tab and click on the name of the most recent version. *Do not select the Download button*

2)	find out if your computer a 32-bit or 64-bit. If you don't know, type in your start menu "Settings".
Then click "System"
Then click "About"
Then look at "System type"

3) 	If you have a 32-bit choose the option that says: .Windows x86 executable installer
	if you have a 64-bit choose the option that says: Windows x86-64 executable

4)	Open the insaller file, then click *Custom Installation*, then *Next* untill you get to *Advanced Options*. Leave the checked boxes as they are, but make sure "Install for users" and "Add Python to environment variables" are also checked. Then click *Install* and *Next* at each prompt.

5)	After it is finished installing, click your *Start* button and search for the *Command Prompt*
The next couple instrutions you need to type exaclty how I put it. Exactly (or just copy and paste honestly). So in the Command Prompt, type:

6)	python -m pip install -U pip
	#Push enter

7)	pip install pgzero
	#Push enter

8)	Now everything should be installed. Skip down past the mac instrucitons






If you have a Mac (The one with the apple on it)

1)	Go to www.python.org and click the "Downloads" tab and click on the name of the most recent version. *Do not select the Download button*

2)	 Choose the option that says: macOS 64-bit/32-bit installer

3)	Double-click the ".pkg" file in the *Downloads* folder to start the installation. Select *Continue* and then *Install* to accept the default settings.

4)	Open the Terminal app, it is in your Applications folder, or you can search for it with Spotlight. In the following steps, type exactly what I type. Exactly. So in the terminal, type (or just copy and paste honestly):

5)	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

6)	brew install python3
	#Push enter

7)	brew install sdl sdl_mixer sdl_sound sdl_ttf
	#Push enter

8)	pip3 install pgzero
	#Push enter







Now that everything is istalled:
